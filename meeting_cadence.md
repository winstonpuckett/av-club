# Training sessions

## Meeting purpose

Training sessions are targeted sessions where the explicit purpose is to grow a specific competency. They require 3 members, one of whom should be an expert in the subject. These are usually conducted in less-busy times when no participant has extra duties, but could be conducted during a live event if deemed more effective. In the case of a live event, only two team members are required.
