# Values

- Consistency
- Simplicity
- Curiosity

# Consistency

We want the audio to be of good quality regardless of the day.

# Simplicity

We aim to keep the signal chain as simple as possible, while enabling quality sound. As such, we often ask, "what can we take out to make this better?"

# Curiosity

We value quality over tradition. That is to say, we are in a constant search for better ways of producing sound in each other's techniques and in the world around us.
