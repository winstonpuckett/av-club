# Purpose

Core values allow team members to act autonomously in unison.

# Values

- Consistency
- Simplicity
- Curiosity

# Consistency

- We strive to provide good quality audio regardless of day.
- We care for the equipment before, during, and after a performance.
- We are safe to ask others for help.
- We take pride in the quality of our work.
- We are aware of needs of the moment, and strive to adjust quickly.
- We are aware of procedures in place to improve quality.

# Simplicity

- We are courageous to remove solutions which no longer provide value.
- We reset temporary-fixes after the day is done, notating them if necessary.
- We are not afraid to reset the board on a regular cadence.
- We search for ways to reduce "magic" - Solutions which are hidden from the user.
- We document needless complexity (what **and** why), so later it can be revised.

# Curiosity

We value quality over tradition. That is to say, we are in a constant search for better ways of producing sound in each other's techniques and in the world around us.
- We value quality over tradition.
- We believe our current knowledge is incomplete.
- We believe a better answer lies outside of us.
- We search individually to further our knowledge-base.
- We ask questions when we don't know something.
- We evaluate solutions based on "result and complexity" instead of how much they align with our current understanding.
